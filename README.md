# Haskell Sort Function Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Haskell related to the `sort` function from `Data.List`.  The issue arises when dealing with lists that might not be sorted in ascending order. In such scenarios, the `sort` function may behave unexpectedly or not produce the results one may anticipate.  The bug manifests differently depending on the order of elements in the input list.

## Bug Description
The `sort` function itself is correctly implemented and should always produce a sorted list. However, if the program logic relies on the assumption that lists are sorted in a certain way (ascending or descending) without explicitly checking, it might lead to unexpected program behavior. 

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run `bug.hs` using a Haskell compiler (like GHC).
3. Observe the output and note that while the sorting works, unexpected results might be encountered if it was assumed the original list was sorted.
